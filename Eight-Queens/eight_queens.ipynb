    "The [Eight Queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) is a famous puzzle that has been studied extensively in- and outside of computer science. It was first published in the chess magazine _Schach_ in 1848. \n",

    "#### Hill-climbing search\n",
    "Hill-climbing search (Section 4.1.1 in R&N 2016) is a very general and intuitive class of algorithms. Hill-climbing methods can be applied if one is able to assign a _value_ to each state on the search-path. The algorithm then continuously moves towards higher-valued states (that is, climbing uphill). The algorithm terminates if there is no higher-valued state in the current neighborhood.\n",

    "The pseudo code suggests to define two classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a `Problem` class that contains an initial state and\n",
    "2. a `State` class that can compute its own value and can compare the values of its neighbor states. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State representation\n",
    "Hill-climbing search uses a **complete-state formulation**. In the 8-queens problem, a complete state is a placement of 8 queens on the chessboard. It is obvious that each column has to contain exactly one queen for a state to be a solution. A state will thus be defined by a one-dimensional array $a$ of length 8: each element $a[i]$ represents the row position of the queen in the $i$-th column. The **neighborhood** of a state is defined as all possible states generated by moving a single queen to another square in the same column.\n",

    "#### Value function representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of a state is represented by the number of pairs of queens that are attacking each other, either directly or indirectly. For example, the state in the figure on the left has a heuristic cost of 6. Because this heuristic value function actually represents \"negative value\", we can also speak of a **cost function**. A solution is a state that has zero cost. Adapt the pseudo code of Figure 1 to account for the use of a cost function rather than a value function!"
